# Lesson I Learned When I Training GAN

## Why GAN is so hard to train compared with other
1. Very sentitive to hyperparameter
2. Very sentitive to minor architecture
3. There is too many technique to try, just like two watch at the same time
3. More is coming

## My Lesson
1. If you are creating novelty in GAN, it is better to play safe rather than play risk
2. Spend some time on your model to retrain it before killing the idea
3. More is coming

## Common GAN Training Problem
1. Generator overpower
2. Discriminator overpower
3. Mode Collapse
 - can try learning rate
4. Vanaishing gradient
5. Various artifact are waiting you
    - ghost artifact
    - and more
